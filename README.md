Vivid-VR provides research code and reproducible tools that extract semantic concepts from modern text-to-video diffusion transformers and apply them to photorealistic video restoration. The project fuses diffusion-based priors with classical restoration modules. It targets real-world tasks: denoising, deblurring, stabilized upsampling, and artifact removal for short clips and long-form video.

Overview
Vivid-VR combines concept distillation with diffusion transformers. It extracts latent concept tokens from text-conditioned video diffusion models. It uses those tokens to guide restoration networks that preserve photoreal structure while removing noise and motion artifacts. The code covers data handling, model wrappers, training loops, and evaluation tools. Use it to reproduce experiments, run demos, or extend the approach.

Key ideas
- Concept distillation: probe a text-to-video diffusion transformer to find semantic tokens that represent objects, motion, lighting, and texture.
- Guided restoration: feed distilled tokens to restoration backbones as soft priors.
- Hybrid loss: combine pixel-level, perceptual, flow, and self-supervised consistency losses.
- Patch- and frame-level supervision: preserve temporal consistency via optical flow and attention-based alignment.
- Modular pipelines: swap diffusion backend, restoration backbone, or loss terms with minimal change.

Paper & citation

Example: use the distiller in Python
```python
from vivid_vr.models.distiller import Distiller
from vivid_vr.models.diffusion_probe import DiffusionProbe
import torch

device = torch.device("cuda:0")
probe = DiffusionProbe("text-video-std", device=device)
distiller = Distiller(probe, token_dim=512, device=device)

video = "data/sample_clip.mp4"
concept_tokens = distiller.extract(video, prompts=["person", "car", "sunset"])
torch.save(concept_tokens, "checkpoints/concept_tokens.pth")
```

Restoration API
```python
from vivid_vr.models.restoration import RestorationNet
restorer = RestorationNet(arch="unet-temporal", token_dim=512).to(device)
restored = restorer.restore(frames, concept_tokens)
```

Training procedure
Training follows three stages:
1. Distiller pretrain: learn stable tokens from a frozen diffusion model.
2. Restoration backbone: train restoration network with distilled tokens as input.
3. Joint fine-tune (optional): adapt both modules end-to-end with low learning rates.

Hyperparameters (default configs)
- optimizer: AdamW
- learning rate: 3e-4 (distiller), 1e-4 (restorer), 1e-5 (joint fine-tune)
- batch size: 4 (per GPU for full frames)
- patch size: 256x256 (for patch-based training)
- schedule: linear LR decay with warmup (default 5000 steps)

Training commands
1. Distiller pretrain
```bash
python training/train_distiller.py \
  --config configs/distiller/default.yaml \
  --data data/train_videos \
  --out checkpoints/distiller
```

2. Restoration training
```bash
python training/train_restorer.py \
  --config configs/restorer/default.yaml \
  --distiller checkpoints/distiller/best.pth \
  --data data/paired_videos \
  --out checkpoints/restorer
```

3. Joint fine-tune
```bash
python training/joint_finetune.py \
  --config configs/joint/default.yaml \
  --distiller checkpoints/distiller/best.pth \
  --restorer checkpoints/restorer/best.pth \
  --out checkpoints/joint
```

Loss functions
- L1/L2 reconstruction at pixel level
- VGG perceptual loss (LPIPS-compatible)
- Flow-consistency loss computed from optical flow alignment
- Concept retention loss: match distilled token activations to guide attention maps

Data pipelines and augmentations
- Random cropping with temporal coherence
- Synthetic degradations: Gaussian noise, motion blur, compression artifacts
- Mix of synthetic and real degradations to improve robustness
- Temporal jitter and frame-rate augmentation for varied motion patterns

Common workflows
- Single-clip restore: run the demo string above
- Batch restore: use the batch runner that reads a folder and outputs restored clips
- Fine-tune on target domain: use a small set of domain clips and run joint fine-tune for 2kâ€“10k steps
- Replace diffusion backend: swap the DiffusionProbe wrapper for a different text-to-video model

Dataset recipes
The repo includes dataset loaders and preprocessing tools for:
- Vimeo-90K (for pairs and motion)
- REDS (for deblurring and super-resolution)
- DAVIS (for real scenes and segmentation-based evaluation)
- Custom datasets: read a folder with consistent naming and create an index file

Example: prepare a dataset from a folder
```bash
python data/prepare_folder.py \
  --input_dir /path/to/raw_videos \
  --output_dir data/custom_dataset \
  --frame_rate 30 \
  --frame_size 1024
```

Evaluation and metrics
Built-in metrics
- PSNR: frame-level peak signal-to-noise ratio
- SSIM: structural similarity index
- LPIPS: learned perceptual image patch similarity
- tOF: temporal optical-flow-based metric for flicker and motion consistency
- tLPIPS: temporal LPIPS across frames to measure perceptual temporal consistency

Run evaluation
```bash
python eval/evaluate.py \
  --predictions demo/results/restored_clip.mp4 \
  --references demo/assets/clean_clip.mp4 \
  --metrics psnr ssim lpips t_of t_lpips \
  --out demo/results/metrics.json
```

Results and benchmarks
We include sample benchmark outputs in the release artifacts. The package contains CSV tables that report standard metrics on the benchmark sets used in the paper. The benchmarks compare:
- Baseline restoration models
- Diffusion-guided restoration without token distillation
- Vivid-VR with distilled concepts and temporal constraints

Representative results (example values)
- REDS validation: PSNR 31.2 dB, SSIM 0.912, LPIPS 0.084, tLPIPS 0.092
- Vimeo-90K: PSNR 30.5 dB, SSIM 0.905, LPIPS 0.091, tLPIPS 0.099

Visual examples
See the release media for full-resolution comparisons. The release package contains before/after side-by-side videos and frame-by-frame stacks. Run:
```bash
bash ./tools/generate_gallery.sh --src demo/assets --out demo/gallery
```

Tips for best results
- Use the distilled tokens that match the main semantic elements in the clip.
- If the clip has rapid motion, increase temporal neighborhood size in config (frames_nbors).
- For low-light footage, include a light-correction module in the pipeline.
- For very high-resolution video, restore at 1/2 or 1/4 scale and use a super-resolution final pass.
- Fine-tune on a small set of target clips to improve domain alignment.

Troubleshooting checklist
- GPU memory errors: reduce batch size or crop size. Set torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False.
- Slow runtime: use fp16 mixed precision via torch.cuda.amp.
- Unexpected artifacts: verify the concept token file matches the clip domain. Try re-extracting tokens with shorter prompts.
- Mismatch in frame rates: resample input to match training frame rate or set temporal interpolation in config.

CLI tools
The repo includes command-line utilities:
- vivid-vr-restore: batch restore videos with a model and tokens
- vivid-vr-extract: create token files from a clip
- vivid-vr-eval: evaluate a folder of restored clips
- vivid-vr-visualize: save attention overlays and flow fields

Example CLI usage
```bash
vivid-vr-extract --input my_clip.mp4 --out my_clip.tokens.pth --prompts "person,car"
vivid-vr-restore --input my_clip.mp4 --tokens my_clip.tokens.pth --model checkpoints/restoration_best.pth --out my_clip.restored.mp4
vivid-vr-eval --pred my_clip.restored.mp4 --ref my_clip.clean.mp4 --out metrics.json
```

Model zoo and checkpoints
The Releases page includes curated checkpoints:
- distiller_best.pth: Distillation model trained on mixed video corpora
- restoration_unet_temporal_best.pth: Restoration backbone
- joint_finetune_best.pth: End-to-end fine-tuned checkpoint
- demo_assets.zip: Sample clips, gallery images, and visualization scripts

Release note: download and execute the file on the Releases page to extract the model zoo and demo assets. The installer in the release will place checkpoints under ./checkpoints and demo media under ./demo/assets.

Reproducibility tips
- Use the same random seed as in config files for deterministic runs.
- Pin library versions via requirements.txt.
- Log hyperparameters and checkpoints. We supply a default wandb config.
- Use the provided eval scripts to reproduce metric tables.

Extending the code
- Replace the diffusion backend by subclassing vivid_vr.models.diffusion_probe.DiffusionProbe.
- Add new restoration backbones in vivid_vr.models.restoration with a standard interface: restore(frames, tokens).
- Implement new loss terms in training/losses.py and plug them into trainer.py.

Examples of extensions
- Add a transformer-based temporal aggregator to replace GRU modules.
- Train domain-specific distillers for medical or satellite video.
- Use text prompts to bias token extraction toward specific objects in the scene.

Benchmarks and ablations
Included in the release are:
- Ablation scripts to compare token injection points (early vs late fusion).
- Temporal neighborhood ablation to measure sensitivity to motion length.
- Loss term ablation to evaluate the weight of flow vs perceptual losses.

Hardware and runtime
- A single NVIDIA RTX 3090 runs the demo for 720p clips in near real-time. Restore speed varies by model and frame size.
- Training requires multiple GPUs for large datasets. Use gradient accumulation for single-GPU setups.
- Mixed precision reduces memory by up to 50% and speeds up training.

Privacy and dataset notes
- Use datasets with clear usage rights for training and evaluation.
- When sharing restored videos, respect privacy and usage agreements.

Troubleshooting logs
If you get model mismatch errors, ensure:
- checkpoint architecture matches config
- token dimension matches restoration model token_dim
- device mapping is correct (use map_location in torch.load for CPUs)

Testing
- Unit tests cover core modules in tests/.
- Run tests with:
```bash
pytest -q
```
- Add tests for new modules following the pattern in tests/test_restoration.py.

Continuous integration
- The repo includes a basic GitHub Actions workflow to run lint and unit tests on push.
- Extend the workflow to run GPU tests on a scheduled self-hosted runner if needed.
